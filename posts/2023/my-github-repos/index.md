This post is a short guide to my Github repositories.

Some of them I use as a wiki for keeping information.
Markdown makes adding and editing text easy, and it can also contain code.

Other repositories have more code to explore a particular topic.  I should expand on some of these topics in future blog posts. 
(Especially the contents and use of the "QMC Algorithms" repository.
It's used as a base for creating validated unit test data for [QMCPACK](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack), and it's a direction I think more projects should move towards.)

## Wiki-like Information

[GPU Internals](https://github.com/markdewing/GPU_internals) - Documentation on how GPUs work and programming models

[ML in scientific computation](https://github.com/markdewing/ML_in_scientific_computation) - Machine learning and scientific computation

## Programming Ideas

[Next Steps in Programming](https://github.com/markdewing/next_steps_in_programming) - Ideas on programming scientific applications.  Includes a focus on code changes a first class/primary object in programming.

[Programming Tutorial Maker](https://github.com/markdewing/programming_tutorial_maker) - Attempt at a tool to make writing incremental tutorials easier.

## Scientific Computing
[QMC Algorithms](https://github.com/markdewing/qmc_algorithms) - Scripts, Jupyter notebooks, Sympy derivations, and code generation to support validating QMC codes. (Also [here](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmc_algorithms))

[QMC Kernels](https://github.com/markdewing/qmc_kernels) - Kernels used in Quantum Monte Carlo in general, and QMCPACK in particular.  Also some simple kernels used to explore GPU offload programming models.

[Small Molecules](https://github.com/markdewing/small_molecules) - Example input files for quantum chemistry packages and information on various small molecules.

[Quadrature](https://github.com/markdewing/crispy-quadrature) - Multidimensional quadrature algorithms. (Technically "cubature").  In addition to notes and links, this has some implementations.

[Floating point](https://github.com/markdewing/silver-floating-point) - Floating point arithmetic.  Particularly for exploring low precision.
(the 'silver' part of the repository name comes from Github's initial repository name suggestion)

[Symbolic Derivatives with Code Generation](https://github.com/markdewing/derivative_code_gen) Represents scientific computations using Sympy. It can take derivatives symbolically, then code generate the result to Python, Julia or C++.

[Multitevo](https://github.com/markdewing/multitevo) Translation of CoMD molecular dynamics miniapp to other languages, such as Python and Julia. And Javascript, should I get it checked-in and pushed.
